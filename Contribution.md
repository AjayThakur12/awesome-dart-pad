## How to contribute
### Create an Issue
Reporting an issue is a great way to contribute. Your feedback and the conversations that result from it provide a continuous flow of ideas. However, before creating a ticket, please take the time to discuss and research first.

### Create a Pull Request

If you want to know how to share DartPad check the [Sharing Guide](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-pad/wiki/Sharing-Guide) 

- Use a meaningful name to your commit.
- Use the following format: `[resource](link) by [Author](link to author) (date)`
- Flutter is all about UI, use screenshots and animated media for your dart-pad sample.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- The pull request should have a meaningful title and include a link to the dart-pad sample and why it's awesome.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.

### Participate in Reviews
Helping to review pull requests is another great way to contribute. When reviewing pull requests, however, please refrain from approving or rejecting a PR.

Thank you for your suggestions!
